### Python 101

I taught the introductory course for Python at GA durign 2017. We covered multi-platform installation as well as begining coding techniques and vizualization. See my github area for the course Jupyter python notebook files and slides: [Python 101 files](https://github.com/AstroHyde/python-programming-101)
