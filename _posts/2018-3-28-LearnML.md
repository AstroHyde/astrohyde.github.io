### How to get started: Learning Machine Learning

The subject of Machine Learning covers many areas from standard deductive statistics (mean-median-mode, standard deviations, etc.) through inferential statistics (p-values, 2 sided testing, multivariate analysis, etc.). Generally the type of Machine Learning algorithm you choose will depend on the data and the type of question you are trying to answer with it. Most Machine Learning processes include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, training, verification and retraining. Many of the tutorials for this are in the Python or R programming languages as they have pre-existing packages for running many advanced models. For distributed computing you would want to consider Spark. Additionally if you wanted to run existing API's you might consider putting your code on one of the cloud platforms such as Google GCP or Amazon AWS. Here are some links to get you started:
