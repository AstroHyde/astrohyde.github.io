### Data Science in Astrophysics

This topic is one that has defined my career path, as I currently work combining Astrophysics with Data Science and Data Science with Astrophysics (when I can). I will cover a short trip around our Milky Way Galaxy and a discussion of how data science can be used to detect faint and sparse objects such as the dwarf satellites and streams that helped form the galaxy we live in. The data science applications and algorithms used determine the accuracy with which we can make detections of these mysterious bodies and with the advent of greater cloud computing capability the sky is no longer the limit when it comes to programming or Astronomy. This presentation is given as an interactive talk, a link to the recent presentation given at Sydney Data Science Meetup will be provided when it goes live.
