## ACAMAR Data Science and Visualisation

This interactive set of workshops and lectures was run from 5 - 7 Aug, 2018 at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, for the 1st ACAMAR Astroinformatics School, Shanghai, China. The session I taught focused on Data Science and allowed students can choose their own data or use existing spectroscopic data to walk through the analytical research process and machine learning. We covered the EDA (exploratory data analysis) on reduced spectroscopic data and how we can prepare and perform for machine learning in astronomical data, and significantly ‘what is machine learning and when should we use it’. Students will learn basic Machine Learning concepts and how to apply them correctly with a Statistical approach as well as some discussion of advanced techniques and visualisation. Students presented their findings on the last day.

### The Basic Preparation for Data Science

The students for this session all had some required prework, I recommend the following for anyone interested in starting up with Data Science:
1. Install Python3 on your local machine https://www.python.org/  with a good command line, for Mac computers I recommend using XQuartz https://www.xquartz.org/ 
2. Install a package manager, I recommend the Anaconda or Conda manager. Note that once this is installed you can have several environments for running Python2, Python3, C, or whatever else you like. https://conda.io/docs/index.html 
+ After Python and your package manager is installed do a conda or pip install to get the following Python packages:
+ Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, sklearn, scipy, dateutil,asci table
3. Install TopCat. This free software will come in very handy for the data exploration section: http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/ 
4. Create a GitHub account, we will put all our codes onto GitHub for version control and demos, you will need an account to be able to clone and fork codes: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
5. Install Jupyter notebook, make sure that you are able to run it from the command line, this will allow us to easily share code and workshop problems together: 
6. Think about what data you might like to use, you will need to have it converted and reduced to rows and columns in asci or csv beforehand or you will be using the GALAH dataset which I will give to the class. If you want to read about GALAH see the website here: https://galah-survey.org/ 
7. Optional reading. You can familiarize yourself with the basics by looking through these in advance:
