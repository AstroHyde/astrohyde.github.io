### ACAMAR Data Science and Visualisation

This interactive set of workshops and lectures was run from 5 - 7 Aug, 2018 at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, 1st ACAMAR Astroinformatics School, Shanghai, China. The session I taught focused on Data Science and allowed students can choose their own data or use existing spectroscopic data to walk through the analytical research process and machine learning. We covered the EDA (exploratory data analysis) on reduced spectroscopic data and how we can prepare and perform for machine learning in astronomical data, and significantly ‘what is machine learning and when should we use it’. Students will learn basic Machine Learning concepts and how to apply them correctly with a Statistical approach as well as some discussion of advanced techniques and visualisation. Students presented their findings on the last day.
