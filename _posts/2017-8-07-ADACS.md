###  Clustering and Grouping: What not do do. 
#### An overview in the context of Machine Learning with a dash of Astrophysics

This topic is one near and dear to my heart as I have seen some remarkable routines used in ways that... well let's just say it wasn't ideal. The basic properties of Machine Learning algorithms start with the basics of Data Science, and this is just as true in Clustering and Grouping routines. I have given versions of a talk on this subject at the 2017 ADACS conference as well as the November 2017 Sydney Data Science Breakfast meetup. For the slides and the code demo see my repo at:
